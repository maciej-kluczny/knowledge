Data describing real world objects can be categorized in four different types as follows:
• Type1: permanent static data, usually provided by a map data supplier.
• Type 2: transient static data, obtained during operation, e.g. changed static speed limits.
• Type 3: transient dynamic data, e.g. weather situation, traffic information.
• Type 4: highly dynamic data, e.g. CAM.

The analysis of ITS applications is based on following applications:
• Driving assistance -Co-operative awareness (CA).
• Driving assistance - Road Hazard Warning (RHW).
• Co-operative speed management (CSM).
• Co-operative navigation (CN).
• Location based services (LBS).
• Communities services (CS).
• ITS station life cycle management (LCM).
• Transport related electronic financial transactions (road tolls).
